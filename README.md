I think this article is very interesting because it talked about a potential problem with AI and more advanced technology. Although AI can make many things a lot easier, it could face some controversy. One example is facial recognition. As of now, there are AI technology that can generate a person's face or make predictions about the person's physically appearence based on the information they have. These kinds of technology raised some controversy because some minorities are not considered and it could leads to racism issues.
