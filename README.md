I think this article is very interesting because it talked about a potential problem with AI and more advanced technology. Although AI can make many things a lot easier, it could face some controversy. One example is facial recognition. As of now, there are AI technology that can generate a person's face or make predictions about the person's physically appearence based on the information they have. These kinds of technology raised some controversy because some minorities are not considered and it could leads to racism issues. 


## Additional Thoughts - Charles Condon
I really enjoyed reading this article because AI is such a major aspect of software development these days. As cool as the technology is, the actual implementation of it is still far from perfect because of the subconscious bias the creators put into the AI. It's nice to see recognition that a lot of the bias is against minorities so hopefully steps can be made to remove such bias as possible in the future.
